# DAT550-2021 Final Project

## Overview

Musical Sheet/Tab Generator	

### Description:

Create neural network capable of "listening to music waveforms" and generate sheet musical notation equivalent in "abc" language.

#### Expected results:
- Train a deep neural network model able to provide given outputs from music waveforms with good accuracy

#### Goal:
To go from music waveforms to  abc format such as in https://piano2notes.com/file/7747aefc-c516-47b3-abdb-dbcda1649a65 (Does not generate abc but  music sheet)
